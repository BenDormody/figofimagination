        "The stars twinkle so bright you seek a song, \r\na nocturne with words to sing along. \r\nYou draw a line between their bright shimmer,\r\nTheir dazzling lights you aim to decipher. \r\nWith steadfast nature you scribe a sonnet, \r\nIts glimmer outshines a diamond locket\r\nYou paint starry nights that loom so high, \r\nWith canvas you express and they reply. \r\nAll the auroras' nuances you do pursue, \r\nPicking terms and meaning to make them true.\r\nThe stars are all yours,you know them the best\r\nOnly you can express them with such finesse.\r\nBut as you spout your rhythm and rhyme, \r\nThe stars continue to sit there and shine."

No more lies?\r\nI hate the scintillating stars so high.\r\nAgoraphobic, they blight sightly skies;\r\nWith unsubtle twinkle, glib do they fly.\r\nI hate the leaves too, in all shapes and shades:\r\nThey litter earth's ground with a rotting waste,\r\n and camouflage beautiful light green blades,\r\nAll to abandon ally tree in haste.\r\nI hold you not in the likeness of these.\r\nUnlike stars, selflessly you shine above,\r\nUnlike leaves, you're an ally to the trees,\r\nI lack hate for you; in that absence, love.\r\nI wish this nuance you truly did see,\r\nMaking this poem not apostrophe."
